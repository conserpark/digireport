                <h4>Report on a Visit to Palaeolithic Sites in Korea.</h4>
                <p style="text-align: right;">Professor J. Desmond Clark<br />
                    Department of Anthropology<br />
                    University of California, Berkeley</p>
                <p>In the course of the five days spent in Korea as a guest of the Bureau of Preservation of Cultural
                    Prop&shy;erties and the Department of Archaeology at Seoul National University I visited two
                    Paleolithic
                    sites and a later Pleistocene cave or fissure site with fossil fauna. I also examined and discussed
                    with
                    the ex&shy;cavators the artefacts and fauna recovered from these localities. My impressions from
                    these
                    brief visits and examination of finds in the University Museums is set out below.</p>
                <div class="chapter_8-1">
                    <h4>Chongokni.</h4>
                    <p>Situated north of Seoul adjacent to the Han Tan River this site was visited on the 17th August in
                        the
                        company of Professor Won-Yong Kim, Director of the excavations since 1979. I was also able to
                        meet
                        and discuss the finds and stratigraph with Dr. Chung and other archaeologists and the geologist,
                        together with Mr. Bae who is supervising the fieldwork. Some four hours were spent examining the
                        sec- tions and the artefacts in the field laboratory.</p>
                    <p>Discreet assemblages of stone artefacts made mostly from quartz and quartzite and more rarely
                        from
                        hornfels and basalt occur within a red clay which may be in part colluvial and in part a
                        reworked
                        loess, since I understand the mineral composition indicates it is not a product of weathering of
                        the
                        basalt, the heavy minerals being dervied from the Pre-Cambrian gneiss. The clay is some 7 to 8
                        feet
                        thick the upper 4 feet of which is less red than the lower 3&frac12; feet which is stained by
                        iron
                        oxides. This deposit is very uniform without any visible evidence of bedding or disconformity.
                        Beneath the clay is some 6 or more feet of &#39;lava gravel&#39; set in a red clay matrix. This
                        is
                        presumably in part colluvial and in part a product of weathering of the basalt. The lava clasts
                        are
                        weathered, sub-angular and have different orientations of the long axis. The basalt bed rock of
                        the
                        plateau on which the site is situated is overlain by a thin deposit of residual clay and in turn
                        lies unconformably on Pre-Cambrian gneiss.</p>
                    <p>Artefacts are most common in the lower 3&frac12;&nbsp; feet of red clay, but they also occur in
                        the
                        overlying paler coloured clay up to about 1 foot from the surface as well as very rarely in the
                        upper part of the colluvial gravel. The artefacts are in fresh condition and it is most likely
                        that
                        a conjoining study of the pieces in a single concentration with produce a number of pieces that
                        join
                        together.</p>
                    <p>The section studied suggests that a relatively long period of time may have intervened between
                        the
                        end of gravel formation and the beginning of the accumulation of the red clay. The artefacts
                        occur
                        sometimes on a single horizon distinguished only by the level of the implements, sometimes as a
                        vertically displaced assemblage and sometimes as isolated tools or debitage. The areal
                        dimensions of
                        these con- centrations is generally small perhaps 1 to 2 metres diameter maximum. Sometimes a
                        single
                        large boulder has been flaked and the debitage is lying adjacent to this together with pieces
                        showing retouch and modification. These occurrences have the appearance of single event flaking
                        activity when perhaps a single individual worked the boulder for a brief period of time. The
                        kind of
                        association where many artefacts and tools are concentrated with features over a relatively
                        large
                        area suggestive of a multi- purpose activity site was not seen. The occurrences seen in
                        photographs
                        and slides all have the ap- pearance of relatively brief, one-time workshop areas so that the
                        camping places were presumably situated elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The raw material occurs in the form of large boulders and cobbles and can be found in the present
                        river bed and in residual patches of river gravel on a bench some 20 metres above the present
                        stream; the source of the material for the Palaeolithic occupants of the site might have been
                        either
                        of these places.</p>
                    <p>The artefacts comprise an assemblage with the following components:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chapter_8-2">
                    <h4><em>Shaped Tools.</em></h4>
                    <p><em>A. Heavy Duty.</em> 1 . Bifaces 2. Picks 3. Core Scrapers 4. Polyhedrons 5. Sub-Spheroids</p>

                        high-backed discoid.</p>
                    <p>Bifaces. It is these artefacts that have given the suggestion that the assemblage may belong in
                        the
                        Acheulian Industrial Complex. Forms resembling the Acheulian ficron are present but only rarely
                        (I
                        saw perhaps only one or two). Other rare forms are limande and ovate to discoid. There are also
                        two
                        artefacts, one on a large cortex,end-flake bilaterally trimmed and with convergent cleaver-like
                        bit
                        and the other on an aberrant side-flake that bear resemblances to a cleaver. Other specimens are
                        less regularly retouched and show discontinuous flaking to form irregular bifacial artefacts. A
                        characteristic of most of these specimens is their thickness especially at the butt or proximal
                        end.
                        The primary form is a flattish ellipsoid cobble or a large flake often with cortex struck from
                        large
                        boulder cores. Retouch is by hard hammer and flake scars show deep negative bulbs.</p>
                    <p>Picks. Two or three artefacts were noted that resemble rostroid and pointed tools having a flat
                        ventral face and steep dorsal retouch along both converging lateral edges so as to form a high
                        backed keel.</p>
                    <p>Core Scrapers. These with the bifaces are the most characteristic tools in the collections. Many
                        may
                        be single platform cores with one or more areas of the edges showing what appears to be
                        secondary
                        modification to produce a steep, near 90 degree working angle. They may show one, two or more
                        edges
                        worked in this way; they range in dimensions from large to small forms.</p>
                    <p>Polyhedrons and Sub-Spheroids. Several of these artefacts were noted. They probably represent the
                        ini&shy;tial and intermediate stages towards the true spheroid. The sub-spheroid forms show
                        characteristic bat&shy;tering of the aretes resulting from pounding and use as hammerstones.</p>
                    <p>Light Duty Tools.Scrapers made on flakes, flake fragments and chunks show straight, convex and
                        den&shy;ticulated retouched edges. Sometimes the retouch is continuous and carefully done but
                        mostly
                        trimming is irregular and casual. These are diminutive forms of the Heavy Duty core scraper and
                        the
                        two classes of tool grade into each other. Several small artefacts show what appear to be
                        opposed
                        notches on an edge to form a shallow bee or borer. A number of pieces show notches that appear
                        to be
                        artificial.</p>
                    <p>Modified/Edge Damaged. These are mostly flakes and flake fragments that show micro-chipping and
                        crushing that simulate the wear resulting from use. Low power microscope examination might show
                        if
                        this is natural or artificial. Such tools would be useful as knives, while cores showing this
                        modification simulate core-scrapers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chapter_8-3">
                    <h4>Unmodified Waste</h4>
                    <p>Flakes. These are irregular side and end struck forms having usually a broad inclined striking
                        platform and irregular one or two directional flaking on the dorsal face. Bulbs are prominant on
                        quartzite pieces.</p>
                    <p>Cores. These are predominantly single-platform examples. Cortex sometimes forms the platform. In
                        addition angle cores (where flakes are struck alternately from both faces of a single edge);
                        also
                        noted were two biconical cores and one high-backed discoid core with radial flaking.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chapter_8-4">
                    <h4>Technology.</h4>
                    <p>Hard hammer technique such as is typical of Lower Palaeolithic assemblages appears to be
                        universal&shy;ly used and no evidence of the Levallois method was seen. Informality is the
                        keynote
                        of the industry. The most characteristic tools are large and small artefacts with steep scraping
                        edges resembling some of the Australian and East African forms of chopper. Edge damaged flakes
                        do
                        not appear to be uncommon and the bifaces and pick forms are a special feature. This informality
                        makes classification of the industry dif&shy;ficult by any morphological method and one based on
                        attributes would be much more satisfactory.</p>

                    <h4>Dating.</h4>
                    <p>In the absence of fauna this is not easy. The assemblage technically and typologically bears some
                        resemblance to Early Acheulian assemblages from East Africa. However such informal artefact
                        forms
                        are found over a wide range of time even into the later Pleistocene. The lower age limit appears
                        to
                        be confirm&shy;ed by a K/Ar age of 270,000 yrs B.P. for the basalt lava flow on which the
                        artefact-bearing clay rests. If such an age is confirmed, and new samples have been taken and
                        submitted to Professor Curtis&#39;s Laboratory at Berkeley, then the industry can be no older
                        than
                        the late Middle Pleistocene. Allowing for the weathering of the basalt and deposition of the
                        overlying gravels to accumulate for the most part prior to the archaeological occupation the
                        most
                        probable interpretation is that the Chongokni industry may represent a terminal Lower
                        Palaeolithic.
                        It would therefore belong in time to the Last Interglacial period though I saw nothing that
                        would
                        necessarily preclude its being somewhat later.</p>
                    <p>About 1㎞ downstream I examined briefly with Dr. Chung the stratigraphy at the mouth of a
                        hang&shy;ing
                        valley where a former tributary channel joined the main river. Here the basalt formed a cliff
                        some
                        30 metres high resting unconformably on the tilted Pre-Cambrian gneiss; more than one basalt
                        flow
                        may be present here. At the top of the cliff the basalt is overlain by a variable thickness of
                        red
                        clay loam. Presumably banked against the basalt cliff, since the contact was obscured, and
                        resting
                        on a bench cut into the gneiss and about 20 metres above river level is an unsorted gravel of
                        quartz, quartzite, lava and hornfels boulders, cobbles and pebbles set in a coarse sand matrix.
                        This
                        gravel probably continues north&shy;wards up the silted channel but is obscured by further red
                        loam
                        which could have been washed from the clay at the top of the sequence. The tributary channel had
                        at
                        some time in the past been incised deep&shy;ly through the basalt and gneiss to some
                        undetermined
                        depth below present river level. The channel so formed was later aggraded with alluvial
                        sediments up
                        to about 15m above the present stream level.</p>
                    <p>The later sequence of events, therefore, appears to be as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formation of &plusmn; 20m terrace gravel of the Han Tan.</li>
                        <li>Deep downcutting of the main stream and tributary channel to below present river level.</li>
                        <li>Aggradation of alluvium to &plusmn; 15m.</li>
                        <li>Downcutting of the main river to present level leaving the channel sediments hanging.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Up-stream the Han Tan River flowing S.E. takes a wide sweeping bend to the south and swings back
                        to
                        the west again as it passes the basalt plateau with the archaeological site. It is possible that
                        this is a ater channel of the river and that the abandoned sediment filled valley was at one
                        time
                        the main, or a distributary channel of the Han Tan itself. Crucial questions to answer at this
                        locality are-does the &plusmn;20m gravel bench contain artefacts, where in this sequence does
                        the
                        red clay mantle fit, is it older or younger than this gravel, might it date to the period of
                        deep
                        downcutting?</p>
                    <p>Conclusions. These must of the course remain tentative until a detailed study of the artefact
                        assemblages is complete, but from the brief observations I was able to make I gained the
                        impression
                        these occurrences represent temporary flaking and workshop areas where a limited set of
                        activities
                        were carried out. Raw matenal all had to be carried in to the site. The Light Duty and Modified
                        artefacts are the most numerous and the industry may be representative official Lower
                        Palaeolithic
                        culture in Korean. In addition, however, the Heavy Duty component (bifaces, picks etc:) appear
                        to be
                        specialized tools manufactured for certain specific activities. The Chongokni occurrences are
                        certainly not a typical Acheulian but they show some affinities with the kinds of assemblages
                        found
                        in Africa at the time range where Heavy Duty core-axes and picks grouped under the term
                        &#39;Sangoan
                        facies&#39; are believed to be special activity componants of a terminal Lower or early Middle
                        Palaeolithic.</p>
                    <p>Artefact assemblages are, however, a notoriously unsatisfactory method of dating and it is
                        possible
                        the clays might prove suitable for TL dating; it would certainly be worth a try. In summary this
                        is
                        a very interesting regional industry which will probably be found to share features with some of
                        those of com&shy;parable age from northern and central China. The stratigraphy and inferred
                        sequence
                        of events at the locality 1 km downstream makes it likely that the artefact-bearing clays were
                        deposited prior to the inci&shy;sion of the buried channel which would equate with the global
                        lowering of sea-level during the Last Glacial maximum. If this is so then the artefact-bearing
                        clays
                        probably formed during the warmer climate of the Last Interglacial 125,000 to 80,000 years ago.

                    <h4>Sokchangni</h4>
                    <p>Some two hours were spent in Yonsei University Museum with Professor Pow-key Sohn examining the
                        stone
                        artefacts recovered from this site. The specimens from the lower part of the sequence
                        showed&nbsp;no
                        certain evidence of artificial fracture. The first unquestionable artefacts, made from quartz,
                        quartzite and porphyry, occur about the middle of the section and show resemblances to the
                        Chongokni
                        assemblages. If the artefacts I saw are representative of the assemblage as a whole then the
                        biface
                        com&shy;ponent is not so well developed and the overall impression was that the size dimensions
                        were
                        in general less at Sokchangni. The upper part of the sequence contained flakes and at least one
                        opposed platform core with faceted striking platforms. These arc apparently associated with the
                        characteristic wedge- shaped micro-blade core of the Siberian and Japanese Upper Palaeolithic.
                        Professor Sohn informed me that both the flake and bladelet components belong in the same
                        assemblage. Together with these artefacts occur rarely well made bifacial foliate points. The
                        use of
                        porphyry increased significantly through time. Of special interest is the fact that Professor
                        Sohn
                        has been able to fit back a number of the flakes onto the cores (single-platform) from which
                        they
                        were struck. These conjoining pieces are a clear indica&shy;tion of an undisturbed flaking
                        floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>When we drove to the site, c. 150kms south of Seoul near Kongju on the Kum River, I was under the
                        impression that the artefacts came from a terrace formation. On visiting the site, however,
                        reached
                        by ferry crossing to the south side of the river, it transpired that the excavations were in
                        alluvial sediments (alternating gravels, sands and clays) the top of which was only some 2-3
                        metres
                        above the present river level and the main part of the section lay below the bed to a depth of
                        8-9
                        metres. These sediments appear to have formed in a buried channel therefore. The excavations
                        were 2
                        by 2 metre pits and it was necessary to pump the water away in the lower levels resting on the
                        Pre-Cambrian bedrock. It was not possible to see any of these sections since they are destroyed
                        by
                        the annual flooding of the river. Up-slope these alluvial sediments appear to grade into
                        colluvial
                        hillwash which is quite sterile of artefacts. Professor Sohn informed me that he has obtained
                        several radiocarbon dates which range from more than 40,000 BP near the base to &plusmn; 20,000
                        years BP at the top. These sediments and their contained artefacts might be interpreted in two
                        ways.
                        They could represent the sequence accumulated in the buried channel, likely contemporary with
                        the
                        Last Glacial lowering of sea-level. Again since warping is said to have raised the western part
                        of
                        Korea these sediments could be older and date to the time prior to the last marine major
                        regression.
                        In this case the section is presumably composite with at least one unconformity since the
                        assemblage
                        and date within the top levels are clearly in the Upper Palaeolithic.</p>

                    <h4>Yonggul Cave</h4>
                    <p>Situated about 80 kms south-east of Seoul in limestone hill country the site was visited on the
                        20th
                        August in company of Professor Won-Yong Kim and Mr. Bae. The occurrence is a narrow vertical
                        fissure
                        opening about 3 metres above an artificial terrace at the base of the cliff. There are several
                        other
                        openings and at the terrace level from which a strong continuous stream of cold air is coming;
                        this
                        presumably indicates the existence of a fairly extensive cavern system. The fissure has been
                        excavated by Professor Sohn during the last several years. Since the entrance was locked it was
                        not
                        possible to enter the excava&shy;tion but the general nature and dimensions could be seen
                        through
                        the grille. The fissure appears to be some 2-3 metres wide, 4-5 metres long and some 4 metres or
                        so
                        of red cave earth formed the filling the basal layers being visible through another grille
                        covering
                        a lower opening at terrace level. The few pieces of stone I was shown in the Yonsei Museum
                        showed no
                        obvious evidence of artificial fracture. The selection of fossil mammalian remains that I saw
                        comprises bones of rhino, cave bear, hyaena, lion, deer and other animals, together with
                        aurochs;
                        all are of later Pleistocene age. Typical examples of car&shy;nivore and rodent fracture and
                        alteration of bones is to be seen on these fossils. Absence of comminuted bone fragments,
                        matching
                        tooth puncture marks, grawing, in particular of articular ends of long bones, and the relative
                        completeness of many of the bones are all features more characteristic of Carnivore
                        ac&shy;tivity
                        than human work; it is likely that most of this bone waste results from hyaena activity. A
                        number of
                        toe bones show a consistent pattern of gnawing by a small rodent, which gnawed a roughly
                        circular
                        hole through the bone to get at the marrow. The incisors were small and Professor Sohn suggested
                        the
                        animal might have been Microtis. Though, therefore, I saw no evidence suggesting human activity
                        at
                        the site and the bone assemblage is typical of that associated with carnivore lairs, this does
                        not
                        mean that other sites will not be found that are true human occupation sites. Fissures of the
                        Yonggul type would not have been very suitable as dwelling sites and a search for larger caves
                        with
                        horizontal openings near the base of the hills would be more likely places. Of course subsequent
                        filling and blockage by rock- falls at the entrance might make the existing entrance today look
                        small and insignificant. A regional survey of the limestone hill country in particular where
                        this
                        abutts upon open plains could be expected to produce Upper Palaeolithic occupation sites.</p>

                    <p>Chongokni. It is clearly essential to ascertain the age of the artefact-bearing clays. Possibly
                        TL
                        dating might provide the answer together with more geomorphological data. For example it is
                        important to know if artefacts occur in the &plusmn; 20m bench gravels and in the overlying red
                        clay
                        or whether they are present only in the red clays on the Basalt plateau. The age of 270,000
                        years BP
                        for the basalt also needs to be confirmed. A quantitative, attribute analysis of the artefacts
                        assemblages in relation to their depth in the clays will show if any developmental trends are
                        present. Future excavation concentrating on opening up bit by bit a larger continuous horizontal
                        area of the occupation surface would show the nature and relationships of the concentrations of
                        flaking waste and tools to each other and give a better overall ap&shy;preciation or density and
                        patterning. A conjoining study of the artefacts in each discreet concentration should show the
                        flaking methods used and the reduction process, and will show which pieces were taken away to be
                        used elsewhere. An experimental study in flaking quartz and quartzite to replicate the
                        Palaeolithic
                        assemblage will show the nature of the debitage to be expected and the relative frequency of the
                        size categories.</p>

                    <h4><em>Pleistocene Deposits in Limestone Caves and Fissures.</em></h4>
                    <p>I strongly recommend and a survey of the limestone areas since these offer the best opportunity
                        of
                        finding artefacts and fauna together; it is also relatively certain that a systematic survey of
                        likely areas would produce more carnivore lairs and human habitation sites. Such a survey could
                        be
                        conducted by making use of local informants and college students working in conjunction with a
                        University team. Scien&shy;tists from overseas institutions might also with advantage be invited
                        to
                        participate and here care should be exercised to ensure that those with the necessary expertise
                        to
                        supplement that already available in Korea are invited. Such collaboration could lead to most
                        fruitful results. The most promising areas for human habitation sites can be expected to occur
                        around the lower parts of the hills and facing into the more open country where the game would
                        have
                        been most abundant.</p>
