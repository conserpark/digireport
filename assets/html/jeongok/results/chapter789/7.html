                        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
                        <p>The paleolithic site of Chongokni first came to our attention by a discovery of, among
                            others, a
                            quartz&shy;ite handaxe and a cleaver, by Mr. Greg Bowen, then an American soldier stationed
                            at
                            the nearby town of Tongduchon, of April 1978, and his subsequent report of the discovery to
                            Won-yong Kim in the following month. Upon receiving his report along with serveral lithics
                            collected there, Kim visited the site area and collected more artifacts at a new locality.
                            Young-wha Chung of Youngnam University, who was trained under Professor Francois Bordes at
                            University of Bordeaux, was notified the discovery of the site by Kim, and later succeeded
                            in
                            locating a still new locality (cf. below).</p>
                        <p>In March 1979, Won-yong Kim, under the auspices of the University Museum, Seoul National
                            University, organized an inter-varsity team for a long-term research of the site, which
                            includes
                            a majority of the students of Korean paleolithic archeology and some other specialists of
                            the
                            ielaled fields of Qualei- nary sciences. Following is the list of the names of the members
                            of
                            the team, as well as of their affiliations and specialties.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>After discussions regarding the mode of the proposed long-term research of the site, members
                            agreed to test Locality 2 (cf. below) for the first phase of the research, since it
                            apparently
                            produced most numerous artifacts during the surface surveys and preservation of the original
                            deposits appears to be bet&shy;ter than other localities.</p>
                        <p>The first campaign took place between March 26 to April 13, 1979. 10&times;10m square grids
                            were
                            laid over the entire area of Locality 2, and four of them, which crosscut the central part
                            of
                            the area in diagonal direction (i.e., SW to NE; cf. Figure 3), were selected for the initial
                            testing. Nevertheless, due to logistical and time limitations imposed, the actual testing
                            was
                            made on one-quarter area of each grids selected. The first campaign succeeded in providing
                            information on the general stratigraphic nature of the site as well as the stratigraphic
                            positions of artifact horizon(s), however, no special features or faunal remains were
                            discovered
                            until the completion of the fourth campaign (cf. below).</p>
                        <p>The apparent significance of the nature of the paleolithic industry of the site attracted
                            quite a
                            large number of visitors during the first campaign, both Korean and foreign scholars.
                            Professor
                            Tadashi Nishitani of Kyushu University, Japan, who was staying in Korea as a visiting
                            scholar to
                            Seoul National University, joined the first campaign. Professors Chosuke Serizawa (Tohoku
                            University, Japan, ar&shy;cheology) and Naotsune Watanabe (Tokyo University, Japan,
                            geochronology) were invited to observe the first campaign from March 29 to April 8, 1979.
                        </p>
                        <p>The second campaign was undertaken for a period of one month, from September 21 to October
                        </p>
                        <p>20,1979. Funds for the second campaign were provided by the Institute of Cultural Properties.
                            Upon the completion of the second campaign, a negotiation with the government had succeeded
                            in
                            securing the governmental sponsorship for a 10-year project of the Chongokni research
                            starting
                            from 1980, and a semi-permanent structure was built at Locality 2 during the second campaign
                            with governmental sup&shy;ports as a shelter and field office for the campaigners.</p>
                        <p>The third campaign was taken place for two months from October 3 to December 3, 1980. The
                            fourth
                            campaign lasted for one month in 1981 (October 17 to November 15). The composition of the
                            researchers at this time should have been changed, however, because of the delay in
                            processing
                            and submitting reports on the earlier campaign results by some participants. Also, the
                            National
                            Museum decided to withdraw from the Chongokni project permanently, thus, the fourth campaign
                            was
                            solely ex&shy;ecuted by the Seoul National University team.</p>
                        <p>This summary is based mainly on data surmised by the Seoul National University team. The
                            entire
                            draft for Korean text regarding the archeology of Chongokni, as well as the drawings of
                            lithics,
                            was prepared by Kidong Bae, followed by reports of specialists of Quaternary sciences on
                            their
                            parts of the research. Also, it includes a report on the background geology and
                            geomorphology,
                            as well as geochronology and stratigraphic nature of the site area by Seonbok Yi, who had
                            been a
                            staff member of the University Museum of Seoul National University until he left for the
                            U.S.
                            for graduate study at Arizona State University in 1980, with a Korean translation by
                            Hui-joon
                            Yi.</p>
                        <p>Upon reporting the results of the first four campaigns at Chongokni, special words of
                            appreciation should be given to those many anonymous individuals who made this publication
                            possible, especially to the students and the staff members of the Department of Archeology
                            and
                            the University Museum, Seoul National University. Also, Professor Minoru Kojima of Tokyo
                            University has kindly conducted a K-Ar analysis of the basalt sample taken from the site for
                            the
                            benefit of the campaign, which provided the first approximation on the &quot;absolute&quot;
                            chronological limit of the lithic industry of Chongokni (cf. Chapter 6 ).</p>

                        <h5>SITE, CHRONOLOGY AND INDUSTRY</h5>
                        <p>The site of Chongokni is some 50㎞ north of Seoul (38&deg;01&#39;6 &quot;N., 1 27&deg;03
                            &#39;45
                            &quot;E.). The Hantan River, a tributary of the Imjin River, makes a U-turn at the site
                            area,
                            surrounding from three directions (E, N, W), Pleistocene terrace (cf. Chpter 5). The terrace
                            exhibits almost flat, nevertheless gently sloping, surface toward the river with elevation
                            between ca. 50 to 60m, ca. 30 to 40m above the normal level of the Hantan River. Although
                            artifacts are occurring at various locations, only the southern portion of the township of
                            Chongokni, where deposits are well preserved and there are few per&shy;manent structures,
                            was
                            designated as &quot;official&quot; site area (total area ca. 2㎢). Thus, further destruction
                            of
                            the current site area by cultivation, construction, and, above all, procurement of red clay
                            for
                            brick pro&shy;duction by brick manufactories there is prevented under governmental

                        <p>The locations of the 4 officially recognized localities are indicated in Figure 2. Locality
                            1,
                            the original locus of the 1978 discovery, is situated on the southwestern end of the
                            terrace, to
                            the west of a road leading from the town to the river. Locality 2, identified by Won-yong
                            Kim,
                            lies to the east of the road, also close to the river. Locality 3 was confirmed by Young-wha
                            Chung, and located between Locality 2 and the birck manufactories. Finally, Locality 4 is
                            across
                            the river, opposing Locality 1, which was iden&shy;tified in 1979.</p>
                        <p>Reports by S. Lee, T. Park and Seonbok Yi on the geology and geoarcheology of chongokni
                            essential&shy;ly summarize the various aspects on the geology of the site area, thus,
                            interested
                            readers should consult with their writings for understanding the general geoarcheological
                            features of the site and its vicinities. It is only necessary here to reiterate the point
                            that
                            the sediments of the site (and the Hantan Basin) appear to be of fluvio-lacustrine origin,
                            although the degree of colluvial processes involved in the basin sedimen&shy;tation would
                            probably as important. Also, both the upper portion of the sediment deposits of reddish
                            brown
                            clay (the so-called &quot;red clay deposits&quot;) and the lower one (mostly coarse-grained
                            sand
                            deposits) may include artifact horizons.</p>
                        <p>Since the area excavated by the Seoul National University team is mainly located on higher
                            elevation, sand deposits were apparently absent or very thin (ca. 20㎝) on the stratigraphic
                            profiles complied by workers from Seoul National University. Well developed sand deposits
                            were
                            found in areas covered by the members of Youngnam and Konguk University. The stratigraphic
                            relationship between the clay deposits of higher elevation and the sand deposits of lower
                            elevation has been a subject of some dispute among the members who participated in the
                            campaigns. During the course of the second campaign, in order to resolve the claims
                            regarding
                            the stratigraphy, a control pit of irregular shape(cf. Figure 3) was&nbsp;tested. From the
                            control pit, time-transgressive relationship between the sand and the clay deposits was
                            clearly
                            seen.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, disputes are far from resolution, since Yong-hun Hwang, who dug a long trench
                            crosscutting the locality in E-W direction, claimed a stratigraphic break between the red
                            clay
                            layers on higher elevation and those on lower elevation near the Datum Point B (cf. Figure
                            3),
                            arguing that the red clay deposits on lower elevations were essentially retransported from
                            the
                            primary deposits. If such is the case, we may anticipate a rather significant temporal gap
                            between the artifacts collected from the pits excavated by the Seoul National University
                            team
                            and those found in the sandy deposits and/or on the basalt substrate in the central part of
                            the
                            Locality 2.</p>
                        <p>Although Yong-hun Hwang&#39;s position should be examined by detailed microstratigraphic
                            studies
                            and sedimentological analyses, such may not be the case since erosion surface was not well
                            recognized along the proposed &#39;break line&#39; by others who were with him during the
                            excavation. Further, during the fifth campaign of 1982, repeating of sand and clay layers
                            was
                            identified below sand deposits on lower eleva&shy;tion with artifacts distributing on a thin
                            horizontal plain under a red clay layer with minimal degree of post-depositional
                            disturbances.
                            Not only this discovery supports S. Yi&#39;s point that periodic short-term alluviations had
                            been the primary agent for the formatioin of the site, but also it diminishes the
                            plausibility
                            of the redeposition hypothesis. Therefore, at present, there may be no firm stratigraphic
                            evidence to assign the overall assemblages to (at least) two geological episodes which might
                            be
                            significantly apart from each other in temporal sense.</p>
                        <p>Currently, there are four K-Ar dates available on the age of the basalt substrate, thus, the
                            absolute lower limit of the age of the Chongokni Industry is to a degree controllable. From
                            these dates, we now understand that all the lava flows responsible for the formation of the
                            Chongok Basalt occurred during the Bruhnes Normal Epoch, and the final lava flow directly
                            underlying the sediment deposits with ar&shy;cheological materials should have occurred
                            between
                            ca. 0.4 to 0.15 MY ago, considering the error inter&shy;vals of K-Ar dates (cf. Chapter 5
                            and
                            6). More direct data on the formation of the site are, however, currently not available. Two
                            sediment samples were collected by Seonbok Yi during his fieldwork in Korea in 1983 and
                            submitted to a commercial lab for the purpose of thermoluminescence dating, and a piece of
                            organic material, which was collected in 1979 and reported as a possible subfossil of reeds
                            (cf.
                            Chapter 5), was also submitted to the Laboratory of Geochronology, University of Arizona by
                            Yi
                            for the purpose of C-14 dating, applying the particle-accelerating method. If successful, we
                            may
                            have a more &#39;direct&#39; estimate on the age of the assemblage itself.</p>
                        <p>During the course of excavations, as indicated earlier, no faunal remains were detected,
                            which
                            may be interpretable in relation to the climatic conditions responsible for the formation of
                            the
                            Red Soil in Korea (i.e., humid and probably warm climatic conditions comparable in some
                            sense to
                            those related to the for&shy;mation of limond rouge in Western European Mediterranean basin)
                            (cf. Chapter 5). Also, playnological analyses were generally futile, although some 100g of
                            sediment samples analysed by Seonbok Yi in 1981 at the Laboratory of Palynology of the
                            Department of Anthropology, Arizona State University, pro&shy;duced a single specimen of
                            extremely deformed pollen grain of Pinus species. Therefore, we lack at pre&shy;sent some
                            &#39;basic&#39; information which allows to make economic, ecological and behavioral
                            interpretation of the site and the paleolithic culture. The only data bases we currently
                            have
                            are from sedimentological analysis by Sangman Lee and general geological and
                            geomorphological
                            observations of the site and Han&shy;tan Basin by Seonbok Yi as appeared in this report,
                            both of
                            which are rather preliminary in nature.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, some general conclusions can be drawn out from these meager but valuable
                            informa&shy;tion on the ecology of the early hominid occupation of the Hantan Basin, which
                            may
                            serve for guidelines for future researches. First of all, it is apparent that the early
                            hominids
                            occupied riverine environment, possibly exploiting the river-bank gallery forest eco-niche,
                            as
                            is the case of many early African hominid sites. Secondly, while the present
                            geomorphological
                            relief of the surrounding uplands is rather rugged and quite contrastive to the Hantan Basin
                            itself, in spite of the generally low elevation of the former, assuming that the rapid
                            development of the Red Soil and erosional processes had been characteristic since the final
                            lava
                            flow of the Chongok Basalt (cf. Chapter 5), we may project a much sharper geomorphological
                            and
                            ecological contrast between the Hantan Basin and the surrounding uplands during the late
                            Pleistoncene; that is, a vertically diversified ecological niches within a relatively short
                            horizontal distance. If such was the case during the hominid occupation of the area, we may
                            imagine band(s) of paleolithic hunter-gatherers exploiting ecological diversity within a
                            rather
                            narrow, &#39;closed&#39; ecosystem, thus, may explain the widespread occurrences of
                            artifacts
                            throughout the basin. Thirdly, assuming the above-mentioned ecological conditions and that
                            the
                            same geological processes which enabled the sur&shy;vival of the site area at Chongokni had
                            been
                            working throughout the combined Imjin and Hantan Basin(cf. Chapter 5), we may be able to
                            conduct
                            a study on early hominid settlement pattern by examining lithic assemblages collected at
                            different localities along with other &#39;contextual&#39; information. Probably the site of
                            Chongokni, judging from its location and other environmental settings, may represent only
                            the
                            southern end of the far-stretching settlement-system of the mobile paleolithic
                            hunter-gatherers
                            which awaits to be discovered.</p>
                        <p>In that regard, we are not much disappointed by the failure of discovering some dense,
                            vertically
                            compressed &#39;living-floor-like&#39; artifact concentrations at the site of Chongokni. In
                            fact, the total number of artifacts recovered from the four campaigns by the workers of
                            Seoul
                            National Unversity is rather small-1,082. Probalby the total number of lithics collected by
                            all
                            of the participants in the campaigns in one way or another would be somewhere around 2,000
                            +,
                            excluding those recovered from the sur&shy;face surveys and later campaigns. Thus, in spite
                            of
                            the impression of extremely high frequency of artifact occurrences on the surface, the
                            actual
                            density of discovery can be said very low.</p>
                        <p>In general, artifacts were found in the strata as more or less loose vertical accumulations,
                            although one may distinguish 2 or 3 vertical zones of concentration within the clay deposits
                            which may have some temporal significance. Such pattern of artifact dispersal and low
                            artifact
                            frequency per a unit area are ex&shy;plainable when accepting the fluvial origin of red clay
                            deposits (cf. Chapter 5). Any distinct sets of re&shy;mains resulting from seperate
                            occupational
                            episodes should have been disturbed by sedimentation, being mixed with others to a degree,
                            although the relatively &#39;mint&#39; conditions of many artifacts indicate that the degree
                            of
                            fluvial disturbances might not have been as devastating as one may imagine when
                            consider&shy;ing
                            the general mode of horizontal distribution of artifacts. Thus, it is not at all clear
                            whether
                            statistical tabulations of overall artifacts collected during the excavation would bear
                            directly
                            on behavioral patterns related with site occupation. Probably it is not, and readers should
                            be
                            guided to accept the following descriptions of assemblage as only a summary statistics of
                            the
                            paleolithic implements which may lack any significant behavioral implications.</p>
                        <p>Among the 1,082 pieces collected, 163 can be classified as &#39;shaped&#39; (15.1%), while 56
                            pieces, or 5.2% can doubtlessly be called as &#39;wastes&#39;, when adopting the
                            leiminologies
                            of African school of paleolithic typology (cf. Chapter 1 -1, Table 1 -1). The remainder (863
                            pieces of 79.8%) are composed of flakes of various sizes many of which seem to carry marks
                            of
                            use and/or modification along the edges. All the stone artifacts from the upper portion of
                            the
                            deposits (i.e., reddish brown clay deposits) are more or less in fresh condition without
                            traces
                            indicating that they were severly &#39;rolled&#39;, however, some of those from the lower
                            portion of the deposits (i.e., sand deposits) show erosional scars and wear marks on the
                            surface, which is an expectable difference considering the differences in the entropy levels
                            involved in the depositional processes between the two distinctive sets of sediment
                            deposits.
                            Major tool types in&shy;clude, again relying on African terminologies, handaxe, cleaver,
                            chopper, chopping-tool, polyhedral, knife, scraper (both side-and end-), burin, and many
                            utilized and utilized flakes in various shapes. This list of tool types is in no way meant
                            to be
                            exhaustive, and more studies should be made on lithics for devising a most appropriate
                            typology
                            for the description of the Chongokni Industry.</p>
                        <p>Many of the heavy-duty tools are made of large quartzite flakes, some sidestruck, and
                            preserve
                            original surface (cortex) of raw materials, many of which should be water-worn cobbles
                            derived
                            from the Baeguiri Formation underlying the Chongok Basalt (cf. Chapter 5). In spite of the
                            extreme coarseness of the raw materials and seemingly irregular tool shapes, it is still
                            apparent that some of the side-scrapers were deliberately made after certain modal forms,
                            and
                            skillful, systematic exploitation of the extremely unfavorable quality of raw material is
                            evident. Although the reason to turn the site of Chongokni into an archeologists&#39;
                            celebrity
                            in the region is the discovery of &#39;Acheulian-like&#39; handaxes and that many handaxes
                            were
                            collected during the surface surveys, the total number of handaxes actually recovered from
                            the
                            four seasons of excavations remains to be 5.</p>
                        <p>There are no significant differences in tool types between those collected from the two sets
                            of
                            sedi&shy;ment deposits, but the ratio of heavy-duty tools against light-duty ones is
                            apparently
                            slightly higher among those collected in sand deposits. When the original shapes of blanks
                            for
                            the manufacture of heavy-duty tools were reconstructed, it seems that diversification is
                            rather
                            a rule, which may indicate the application of the so-called &#39;block-on-block&#39;
                            technique
                            for the initial procurement and shaping of the raw materials. The application of the
                            side-blow
                            flaking seems to be limited for the manufacture of rather elegantly shaped ones, such as
                            handaxes, cleavers and knives. The predominant flaking angle ranges be&shy;tween 105&deg;
                            and
                            110&deg; among heavey-duty tools, which in many cases were struck along the cortex plain.
                            Thus,
                            secondary retouch is rather limited in its application, even among the small, light-duty
                            tools.
                            So far, only about 1 5% of the total artifacts indicated the evidence of secondary retouch.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a tempting question whether one can formally call the assemblages from Chongokni as
                            classifiable to the so-called &#39;Acheulian Industry&#39;. In fact, judging from the tool
                            types
                            and assemblage&nbsp;composition, the name of Acheulian is applicable for the description of
                            the
                            assemblages so far identified. However, by calling it having characteristics of the
                            Acheulian,
                            we do not want to make an impression that we would accept the implications and connotations
                            attached to the African and European, as well as other west Asian, Acheulian assemblages in
                            a
                            wholesale mode, nor do we ignore the apparent prob&shy;lems in culture historical approaches
                            in
                            the study of paleolithic archeology. Also, the &quot;absolute&quot; age of the industry is
                            not
                            yet settled. Truly, such a designation would rather hinder than assist archeologists for the
                            study of the dynamics of the regional paleolithic cultures. However, in the absence of
                            standardized classificatory nomenclatures to describe the assemblages with such
                            characteristics
                            as we are seeing from the Chongokni assemblages, we were forced to adopt the name Acheulian
                            for
                            the sake of convenience. Although some common characteristics are found between the
                            Chongokni
                            and the North Chinese assemblages of the so-called &#39;Kehe-Dingcun Tradition&#39;, still
                            there
                            are more problems for us to borrow a terminology from the North Chinese classificatory
                            system.
                            We hope that the current status of the paleolithic archeology in Northeast Asia would be
                            improved one day to allow us to devise an independent typologico-classificatory schemata,
                            which
                            will describe the regional paleolithic assemblages in the most reasonable and parsimonious
                            way.

                        <h5>PROSPECT</h5>
                        <p>Probably the most important significance which had been attached so far to the site of
                            Chongokni
                            since its discovery would be that it provided evidences which enable one to deny
                            categorically
                            the dual phylla theorum so vehemently advocated by Hallam Movius and his followers for such
                            a
                            long time. However, the discussions up to today regarding the nautre of the site and the
                            industry and regarding the nature of the paleolithic cultures in Northeast Asia in general
                            which
                            have appeared in both Asian and Euro-American journals, being inspired by the discovery,
                            have
                            successfully led us to discard the outdated and outmoded notions of cultural parallelism as
                            the
                            most simplistic mode of &#39;explanation&#39;. Such an &#39;achievement&#39; would
                            nevertheless
                            be truly meaningful only when alternative, more reasonable and more compelling,
                            explanation(s)
                            is provided through dialectical processes. For that purpose, our work has bare&shy;ly
                            started.
                            Building such explanatory model(s) essentially requires us to have sound methodological
                            frames
                            of references, which Korean archeology does not have yet. Paleolithic archeology in Korea is
                            still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the very adverse conditions of the current situation
                            become
                            the reasons to be hopeful, since more challenging opportunities are offered. The discovery
                            of
                            Chongokni itself had already effectively made us, the community of Korean archeologists, to
                            challenge the authoritative &#39;theory&#39; on the nature of Asian paleolithic. And we have
                            not
                            yet seen what would be the limits for such challenges. You readers are cordially invited to
                            join
                            us in exploring this valuable oppotunity provided to Korean archeology, and, in that regard,
                            we
                            wish this progress report would make an introduction to future works.</p>
