                <h3>Geoarcheology of Chongokni, Korea<sup>1</sup></h3>
                <p style="text-align: right;">Seonbok Yi<br />

                <p>Since its discovery in 1978, the paleolithic site of Chongokni(or Chon-gok-ni) has attracted
                    ar&shy;cheological attention as it has produced &#39;Acheulian-like&#39; handaxes and cleavers
                    in
                    some quantity despite its location in the far eastern end of the Eurasian continental land mass
                    (Kim
                    and Chung 1978, Kim et al. 1981; cf. Yi and Clark 1983). With the financial and administrative
                    support of the Bureau of Cultural Properties of the Republic of Korea, systematic field research
                    has
                    been conducted at the site by Seoul National University Museum teams since 1979. This short
                    report
                    describes some of the salient aspects of the geology and geomorphology of Chongokni, based on
                    published accounts of the 1979-1982 campaigns and field observations made by the writer during
                    the
                    summer of 1983.</p>
                <p>The archeological site was named after a small town which lies approximately 50㎞ north of Seoul.
                    Including the original discovery, dense artifact occurrences have been reported at four more or
                    less
                    discrete loci which have been officially identified as four separate sites. However, it is now
                    known
                    that paleolithic artifacts are found at numerous localities in the Hantan River basin over an
                    area
                    about 1 6km long by about 4-5km wide. The distribution of paleolithic remains corresponds
                    roughly to
                    the distribution of the so-called &#39;red clay&#39; deposits which in this area have developed
                    over
                    the basalt substrate (K. Bae, personal communication; Figure 1). The Hantan River flows west
                    into
                    the Imjin River approximately 7㎞ downstream from the down of Chongokni. From the confluence, the
                    Imjin River travels SSW at an eleva&shy;tion of approximately 20m over a distance of ca. 50㎞
                    where
                    it debouches into the Yellow Sea at the Bay of Kanghwa<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p>The Hantan and Imjin River basin together comprise the southwestern part of the long and narrow
                    valley, current geological views hold that it is type of rift valley; the name of
                    &#39;Choogaryong
                    Rift Bailey&#39; sula into two distinctive geological zones. While there are conflicting
                    opinions
                    regarding the origin of this valley, current geological views hold that it is a type of rift
                    valley;
                    the name of &#39;Choogaryong Rift Bailey&#39; has recently been proposed (Lee et al. 1983). In
                    this
                    part of the rift, four major geological episodes are known. The earliest is the formation of the
                    basal rocks of the pre-Cambrian &gt;900 MY) Kyunggi Metamorphic Complex, and subsequent
                    instrusion
                    of biotiticgranodiorite and breccia formation during the Jurassic (180-135 MY). The second stage
                    is
                    marked by Cretaceous (135-65 MY) tectonic act&#39;vities, possibly related to the initial
                    formation
                    of the rift valley. The third stage is characterized by long-term ero&shy;sion of pre-existing
                    rocks
                    beginning in the late Cretaceous and continuing into the Quaternary, and by the deposition of
                    the
                    unconsolidated gravel-sand beds of the Baegeuiri Formation. The final stage is mark&shy;ed by
                    volcanism and lava flows of late Quaternary age which led to formation of basalt plateaux within
                    the
                    valley system. These basalts overlie the Baegeuiri Formation, and are themselves capped by
                    alluvial
                    sedimentation in many areas. Erosional cycles of late Pleistocene and Holocene age complete the
                    geological sequence (Lee et al. 1983).</p>
                <p>All of the rocks of volcanic origin formed during the last geological episode were designated the
                    &#39;Chongok Basalt&#39; by Lee and others (1983). K-Ar<sup>3</sup> and paleomagnetic
                    determinations
                    made on the Chongok Basalt suggest formation during the Bruhnes Normal Epoch (ca. .70
                    MY-present)
                    (Lee et al. 1983). It has been suggested that at least 12 separate lava flows are responsible
                    for
                    the formation of the Chongok Basalt; however, only 2 or 3 flows with total thickness of 1 5 to
                    20m
                    were identified within the area shown in Figure 1 . Hominid occupation of the region appears to
                    have
                    begun not long after forma&shy;tion of the basalt plateaux, and apparently continued
                    uninterrupted
                    throughout the entire period of Pleistocene alluvial sedimentation. Large scale downcutting of
                    the
                    stream which ultimately led to the for&shy;mation of the current drainage pattern probably began
                    during or immediately after initial human occupa&shy;tion of the area. Traces of at least two,
                    and
                    possibly as many as four, cycles of stream degradation and aggradation are recognizable
                    throughout
                    the combined Imjin and Hantan River basins (Figure 2).</p>
                <p>Since the lava flows took place within the narrow confines of the existing drainage system, the
                    for&shy;mation of the relatively impermeable plateaux should have created a basin of
                    sedimentation,
                    with subse&shy;quent accumulation of sediments of alluvial and colluvial origin (derived from
                    the
                    surrounding uplands). Since 1979, however, it has been known that, where the surface of the
                    basalt
                    forms natural depressions, deposits of apparently lacustrine origin develop to a maximum
                    thickness
                    of ca. 1.5 to 2m. This seems to indicate that the irregular surface of the basalt plateaux was
                    once
                    dotted with small ponds and lakes</p>
                <p>immediately after the final lava flow. These lacustrine-like marl deposits are overlain by
                    alluvial
                    beds of various thickness and composition which contain rare plant sub-fossiles (possibly
                    rees?)(M.
                    Choi, personal communication). Depending on the elevation, the oldest artifact horizon is found
                    either within alluvial deposits or on top of the basalt bedrock. In the latter case, artifacts
                    are
                    sometimes found immediately on top of a thin, yellow clay layer which is a decomposition product
                    of
                    the basalt (Kim etal. 1981; Hwang 1982, Chung 1980, Choi 1982).</p>
                <p>The &#39;red clay deposits&#39; refers to a massive alluvial stratum of bright reddish color (5
                    YR)
                    formed at the top of the alluvial beds as either primary or secondary deposits. The &#39;red
                    clay&#39; has an exceptionally high clay-size particle content in its composition. Here one or
                    two
                    additional artifact horizon(s) was recognized. Although the record on the development of soil
                    profiles was not carefully kept, the absence of a clear-cut change in color and texture suggests
                    that periodic short-term alluviation produced the deposit. While definitive sedimentological and
                    palynological analyses of samples from excavations are still in preparation, there is an opinion
                    that the &#39;red clay&#39; is eolian in origin, derived from the surrounding uplands under
                    &#39;cold and dry&#39; climatic conditions (cf. Bae 1 983). The stratigraphy and mechanical
                    analyses
                    of sediment composition indicates otherwise (I. Sohn, perosnal communication), however, and
                    support
                    the viewpoint expressed above&mdash;that the &#39;red clay&#39; is water-laid.<sup>4</sup></p>
                <p>That the initial hominid occupation of the area took place soon after the stabilization of the
                    final
                    lava flow is justifiable because (1) the degree of weathering of the basalt below the alluvium
                    prior
                    to homind occupation is not much advanced, and (2) no evidence of unconformity has been observed
                    between any successive sediment layers. In other words, after the cooling of the final lava
                    flow,
                    hominids moved into the area probably following game animals which might have been migrating
                    through
                    the corridor of the rift valley and/or attracted to it by the availability of water from natural
                    ponds and streams formed on the surface of cooled lava. The residues they left there were soon
                    covered by repeated alluviations, and were thus protected from serious disturbance until they
                    were
                    exposed by bulldozers in the late 1970s. However, most, if not all, organic compounds were
                    oxidized
                    under the characteristic climatic conditions responsible for the formation of the Red soil in
                    Korea
                    (Kang 1977, 1979).</p>
                <p>Although there is no reason to rule out the possibility of the survival of other open-air
                    paleolithic
                    sites in Korea, it is also apparent that the Hantan River basin represents a unique opportunity
                    for
                    the study of Korean paleolithic archeology. Severe Holocene erosion and alluviation cycles in
                    other
                    parts of the peninsular greatly diminish the likelihood of the discovery of the remains of
                    pre-sapiens open-air sites in primary contexts (Yi, in preparation). The conditions which made
                    the
                    survival of paleolithic occupations in the Hantan River basin possible can be summarized as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <p>1. Formation of the basalt plateaux in a norrow rift valley insured the appearance of a basin of
                    sedimentation in which archeological sites would be preserved with relatively minor post-
                    depositional disturbance;</p>
                <p>2. Erosion of the plateaux was confined to the major channel of the present river. The
                    characteristic
                    columnar structure and platy cleavage of the basalt bedrock enabled the larger portion of the
                    site
                    area to remain intact; and</p>
                <p>3. The formation of cultural deposits on the top of the basalt plateaux (ca. 20m above the former
                    floodplain) effectively kept the deposits from being subjected to later fluvial disturbances due
                    to
                    changes in the Hantan River base level (i.e., changes in sea level).</p>

                    the
                    Foundation for Research into the Origin of Man (FROM). Additional support for K-Ar dating was
                    made
                    available by the Arizona State University Graduate Student Research-In-Aide Program and the
                    Krueger
                    Enterprises, Inc. I am grateful for financial supports from all of these institutions. Also, I
                    acknowledge with gratitude the coorperation and support of the staff of the Department of
                    Archeology, National Museum of Korea, Seoul and staff and students of the Department of
                    Archeology,

                <p>2. Because of proximity to the DMZ, civilian activities are restricted along portions of the
                    Hantan
                    River&nbsp;and most of the Imjin River, where more paleolithic loci are undoubtedly located.</p>
                <p>3. K-Ar determinations so far obtained are: 0.27 &plusmn;0.12 MY (University of Tokyo, sample
                    number
                    known; W. Kim, personal communication), 0.6 &plusmn;0.2 MY (Krueger Enterprises, R-6648), 0.3
                    &plusmn;0.1 MY (Krueger Enterprises, R-6647), and 2.9 &plusmn;0.3 MY (Krueger Enterprises,
                    R-6646).
                    Information on the exact location of the first sample is not available. Sample R-6646 (2.9
                    &plusmn;
                    0.4 MY) was obtain&shy;ed from a weathered basalt boulder lying nearby the Locality 2, and not
                    from
                    the Chongok Basalt itself. For the stratigraphic locations of the determinations, see Figure 2.

                <p>Figure 1 . Geological map of Chongokni and vicinity (modified from Lee et al. 1983, and The
                    Geological Society of Korea 1955, 1956). &#39;Red clay deposits&#39; develop over the Chongok
                    Basalt, cover&shy;ing it to a maximum thickness of 3 to 5m throughout the area indicated on the
                    map.
                    The clay component of the &#39;red clay deposits&#39; originated by weathering of the Kyunggi
                    Metamorphic Complex, exposed on the surrounding hills and mountains.</p>
                <p>Figure 2. Schematic stratigraphy of Chongokni crosscutting Localities 4 (left) and 2 (right). For
                    the
                    legend, see Figure 1, except A (&#39;red clay deposits&#39;) and E (colluvium and/or talus).
                    Broken
                    line in the middle of the Chongok Basalt indicates the approximate boundary of two separate lava
                    flows. A K-Ar age of 0.6 &plusmn;0.2 MY was obtained from the basalt sample taken at the contact
                    surface between the lower flow and and the Baegeuiri Formation, and an age of 0.4 &plusmn;0.1 MY
                    was
                    obtained from a sample from the bottom of the upper flow. River terrace B covers the
                    out&shy;crops
                    of the Baegeuiri Formation, and is probably Pleistocene in age (more prominent develop&shy;ment
                    of B
                    is found elsewhere). Terrace C possibly consists of 2 components of different ages at Chongokni
                    but
                    differentiation is difficult at this locus. The lower component of Terrace C is dated to ca.
                    650-7
                    50 AD from archeological evidence. D indicates the modern floodplain of the Hantan River.</p>
