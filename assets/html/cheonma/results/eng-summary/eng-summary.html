            <h3>Ⅰ. Preface</h3>
                <p>As part of a 10-year intensive development plan for the historic city of Kyongju, the old capital of the Silla Dynasty (57 B.C. -935 A.D.), 
                    the Ministry of Culture and Information decided last year to form what is called a ‘tomb park’ at a downtown section of the city, which has 
                    a number of ancient mounded tombs including that of King Michu, the 13th monarch. Prior to establishing the park, the Ministry decided to excavate 
                    the biggest Silla tomb ,Tomb 98, to make it an open-air museum. The Ministry’s idea was to open the interior of the huge twin tomb in its original 
                    shape for public viewing. The Cultural Property Preservation Bureau excavated a nearby Tomb 155 as a test case before attacking the main target. 
                    The tomb was later named “Chunma Tomb”, or the Tomb of Heavenly Horse because of the discovery of a magnificient mudguard with the painting of a 
                    heavenly horse.
                </p>

            <h3>Ⅲ. Survey of Underground Remains</h3>
                <p>Prior to the main excavation, test trenches were made in the tomb area for possible subterranean structures. The survey started on March 22, 
                    1973 and lasted for about 20 days until mid-April.
                    No trace of artificial work, however, was detected under the surface in the area. It was assumed that part of the area was a swamp in the ancient times.
                </p>
            <h3>Ⅳ. Structure of the Tomb</h3>
                <p>The tomb stands 12.7 meters high from the present surface and has. diameters of 60m (E.W.) and 51.5m (N.S.). 
                    Surrounding the outer edge of the mound is a low stone circle as a protective measure. Some of the stones, pebbles measuring some 20 centimeters in diameter, 
                    were exposed on the northern side of the mound, about 1.2 meters above the present surface.
                </p>
                <p>The mound was erected by heaping up soil above an inner stone mound piled over a wooden burial chamber. The stone mound over the burial chamber is rectangular 
                    in shape at the bottom, which measures 23.6 meters east to west and 21 meters south to north. The heap of riverine boulders made to protect the burial chamber 
                    gets narrower in the upper part and gradually transforms into an elliptical shape. A stratum of mud, measuring 15 to 20 centimeters thick, 
                    was found between the boulders and the soil over them. But the mud was found only at the part straight above the burial chamber.
                </p>
                <p>A wooden burial chamber was placed at the heart of the mound. From the remains of decayed wood, it is guessed the chamber measured 6.6 meters east to west, 
                    4.2 meters south to north and was 2.1 meters high. Inside the chamber remains of a wooden coffin was found toward west and a chest for mortuary gifts toward east. 
                    Around the coffin was a stone platform on which many burial goods were also placed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stone platform around the coffin is around 50 centimeters wide and 40 centimeters high. The site for the coffin measured 2.2 meters east to west and 0.8 meter 
                    south to north.
                </p>
            <h3>Ⅴ. The Burial Goods</h3>
                <p>Objects outside the burial chamber: Near the summit of the mound, some buried objects such as gilt-bronze horse equipments and fragments of earthenware were retrieved. 
                    Also found near the surface of the mound were some objects apparently buried at later periods.
                </p>
                <p>Objects around the burial chamber: Decayed remains of the chamber were first found at the level some 10.5 meters from the summit of the mound, 
                    which means 2.2 meters above the present surfAce of the surrounding space. Broken sherds of varied styles including a long-necked jar were retrieved to the east, 
                    west and south of the chamber, while not a single object was found to the north. A pair of gold earrings and some glass beads were unearthed at a spot near 
                    the central part of the chamber's southern wall. As excavation proceeded, 
                    more items such as gold earrings and iron pieces apparently placed there as the last offering before closing the tomb were recovered to the south of the chamber.
                </p>
                <p>Objects on the stone platform around the coffin: It is believed that many kinds of personal belongings of the dead person were placed on the platform as mortuary gifts. 
                    But most of them were displaced as the wooden chamber decayed and crushed. Objects on the stone platform included caps made of gold or white birch bark, a girdle, 
                    pendants for belt, and jade ornaments to the east of the coffin; a pair of gilt-bronze shoes to the west; a sword to the south; 
                    and an iron kettle and other vessels to the north. In general personal ornaments were placed on the east side and weapons and vessels were on the other sides.
                </p>
                <p>Objects inside the coffin: Except for a sword, all relics found inside the burial casket are believed to have adorned the dead person for funeral. 
                    The accessories include a crown with pendants, rings, earrings, bracelets, and a girdle. 
                    They are all made of gold and also decorating the body was a necklace made of gold, silver and colored glass beads.
                </p>
                <p>Objects from the gift chest: This wooden box measured 1.8 meters south to north, 1.0 meters east to west and 0.8 meter high. Two upright ornaments for cap - 
                    one seemingly made in the shape of a bird's wing and the other after a butterfly - 
                    and some other accessories were found on the lid of the chest which contained a number of significant objects for studying the life of the people of the ancient kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>Objects in the chest were less disturbed than those found in other parts of the tomb. Horse equipments of various sorts were first found and beneath them were metal 
                    vessels and lacquerware. Potteries of various shapes were placed at the bottom. Among the harnessry found in the chest were four saddles and two pairs of mudguards. 
                    The mudguards made of white birch bark were a historic discovery for 
                    archaeological study of the life of Sill a people as well as invaluable materials for art historians.
                </p>
                <p>Each of the mudguards was adorned with a flying horse painted in white, the oldest painting ever preserved from the Silla Dynasty(ca. 4th-6th century A.D.). 
                    More paintings were found on objects from this tomb, rendering tremendous significance to its excavation. 
                    They were a pair of birch bark discs of unknown use decorated with mounted figures and birds in polychrome.
                </p>
                <p>Other object of importance from the chest were a number of lacquerware pieces decorated with painted designs and bronze, or gilt-bronze vessels. 
                    More interesting discoveries were eggshells contained in a pottery jar and decayed remains of leaves believed to have been used for packing.
                </p>
            <h3>Ⅵ. General consideration</h3>
                <p>The Tomb of Heavenly Horse emerges as one of the very important Silla tombs in Kyongju.</p>
                <p>First, the tomb was the first instance to have a burial chamber built above the present ground level. Second, the stone platform around the coffin was also an unprecedented feature. 
                    It must have evolved from earlier stone pit-burial popular to early Silla. 
                    Third, the separate chest for burial gifts was also a new information about the burial custom of Silla Dynasty. 
                    It is apparently a simplified version of a separate pit for mortuary gifts.</p>
                <p>The man buried in this tomb was no doubt a king. His body was luxuriously adorned with accessories made of gold and jewelry such as gold crown and gold girdle, which attest to the highest social status in silla.</p>
                <p>Antiquities recovered from this tomb surpass in their quality, those from any other tombs of the Silla period excavated thus far Found in a most perfect condition, 
                    the simple-designed golden ornaments eloquently testify the healthy and mighty spirit of the citizens of rising Silla at that time. 
                    Moreover, the paintings on the mudguards and lacquerware pieces show strong resemblance to those of the neighbouring states of Koguryo (37 B.C. - 668 A.D.) 
                    and Paekche (18 B.C. -660 A.D.) 
                    in technique and detail. They are particularly important as the first example of painting from the Silla period found so far.</p>
                <p>The tomb is likely to date from the late fifth or early sixth century A.D. because, among other features, the lotus patterns depicted on the painted pieces have strong analogy with those from Koguryo or Paekche tomb paintings around 500 A.D.</p>    
            <h3>Ⅶ. Conservation of relics obtained from the excavation of Chunma Tomb in Gyeongju, Korea.</h3>
                <p>Relics obtained from the excavation of the tomb were classified to wooden, metallic, textile, and other items, and each item was investigated scientifically. 
                    They are, subsequently, conserved by means of consolidation, electrolytic reduction, fumigation, and other methods. Furthermore, contents of the textile, soil, 
                    and pieces of ruined relics were examined analytically and technologically. A technological review on the origin of each relic was envisaged 
                    on the basis of the reported history of the Silla Dynasty.</p>
                <h4>a. Wooden Items</h4>
                <p>The wooden structure of the inside wall of the tomb, wooden coffin, wooden hats (crown), and wooden boxes for ornamental relics, 
                        which had partly been identified through broken pieces in the previous excava¬tion of this sort of the tomb in Gyeongju, 
                        were identified clearly by excavating a large piece of them. The conservation of these items was, therefore, 
                        envisaged by reinforcing their wooden structures with Carbowax-4,000 resine and sealing them in a moisture controlled box equipped with a thermometer, 
                        hygrometer, and moistening reagents. The wooden horse saddles and accessorries, which were orna¬mented with colored picture on the surface, textile, 
                        gilted metal ornaments, bamboo knitting, and others, were successfully excavated in the present case and hence the investigation and conservation of these items 
                        were achieved for the first time in the Korean archeological history. Samples taken from each part of the wooden relics were examined with a view-point of forestry science. 
                        The forestry classification of the sample was reviewed and compared with the existing flora in Gyeongju area.</p>
                <p>Total 25 items of wooden relics were, thus, examined and conserved scientifically.</p>
                <h4>b. Metallic Items</h4>
                <p>1. All silver objects seemed to be forging products. It was supported by convex dragon design sculptured on silver belt surface.</p>
                <p>2. Gilt-bronze objects were made by the gold amalgam of which mercury might be readily volatilized by heating.</p>
                <p>3. Interface of gold film and bronze in gilt-bronze was cracked due to oxidation of inner metal.</p>
                <p>4. Parts of base metal contacted with noble metal was severely attached by the electro-chemical reaction.</p>
                <p>5. Iron objects were cracked more severely and clushed into a large number of pieces by the emdrittlement of its oxidation.</p>
                <p>6. Iron kettles excavated from the Tomb might be made by a casting iron.</p>
                <h4>c. Textile</h4>
                <p>Chemical and constructional analyses have been made for the textile specimens excavated from the Chunma Tomb in Gyeongju.</p>
                <p>Most of the textile specimens were used for the saddles. Textile fabrics were made from two kinds of natural fibers, i.e. hemp and silk, but the qualities of the yarns used to compose the fabrics were different from fabrics to fabrics.</p>
                <p>Textile weaves of hemp fabrics are plain, but those of silk fabrics are plain and 2/1 twill.</p>
                <p>Some fabrics were dip dyed, but others were printed by some special techniques using two thin pattern plates.</p>
                <p>One of the most striking results of this study is the discovery of the fine beautiful printed silk cloth. The face of the pattern was dyed in violet color but back of them was dyed in deep red color.</p>
                <h4>d. Biological Items (Eggs)</h4>
                <p>Two eggs (large and small size each), which have a complete forms, were excavated from the Chunma tomb Gyeongju, Korea.</p>
                <p>To classify the eggs, various kinds of experiments including bio-chemical analyses were envisaged with the liquid contents of the excavated egg sample.</p>
                <p>According to bio-chemical analysis, organic substances (protein, carbo-hydrate, and amino-acids) were detected. However, due to the denaturation of these substances, it was impossible to classify them experimentally.</p>
                <p>Morphological study done by an expert showed that the large one would be chick's and the smaller a pheasanfs egg, respectively. After completions of immunization schedules which is now in progress, it may be expected to clarify more accurately the origins of excavated eggs according to specific antigenantibody reactions.</p>
                <h4>e. Soil</h4>
                <p>The relationship between soil dug from the Chunma tomb and conservation status of remains inside of the tomb was investigated in the view-point of soil-analysis.</p>
                <p>The area near the tomb was classified as well drained alluvial soil which is composed of silty loam to sandy loam soil. The soil used as its territory was turned out to be brown, reddish-brown soil with traceable amounts of organic matter.</p>
                <p>Judging from the analytical data of soil samples of total potassium and soil color, it seems to be possible that the soil used as its bettitory was originated from sedimentary rock (shell, sand stone, etc.)</p>
                <p>According to the structure of old tomb, wooden frame which is consist of coffin and remains, was seemed to be settled on the surface of soil to prevent the soil reduction due to the underground water between the territory and border of stone piled area.</p>
                <p>One metal thick silt was possibly covered above the clay pan and then sand and silty loam soil were covered up to the top of tomb. These soil layer maintained the water and air permeability and water holding power so that the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter was controlled. On the other hand, the aerobic decomposition was accelerated by soil micro-organisms. These phenomena might result in the good conservation of remains inside of the tomb.</p>
                <h4>f. Chemical analysis of the components of miscellaneous items and radio-carbon dating of the wooden sample.</h4>
                <p>The gold contents of the ornamental relics were analyzed to give values of 19.0% 〜89.0% by means of a radioactivation analytical technique. The calcium and other metallic salt contents of the mixture of soil and ruined relics taken from the surface of the coffin and other bottom part of the tomb were analyzed by means of X-ray fluoresence analysis to show the presence and position of the corpse in the coffin and other biological items. The main composition of miscellaneous items such as hair, ox-horn, shell, and red pigments obtained at the surface of stone file were analyzed.</p>
                <p>It was found that the pigment was composed of iron oxide and other items showed no significant difference in their main components compared with those of items of up-to-date. The radio-carbon dating of wooden samples showed the era of the sample to be A.D. 340 ± 70. </p>
