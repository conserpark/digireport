                which belong to Bronze Age, and a number of burial urns, pit tombs, and stone tombs which belong to
                his-toric
                period. In the present volume, only the prehistoric sites are discussed. The others will be published
                separately in
                future.</p>
            <h4>1. Sites</h4>
            <h5>a) Bronze Age Dwelling Sites</h5>
            <p>The plans are round, rectangular and some of them, irregular. All the plans have subterranean or
                semi-subterranean
                structure. There is a clear difference between the rectangular and round dwelling sites. The former
                shows an oval
                pit in the middle of the plan which has two post holes, while the latter has nothing. Dwelling sites
                produce many
                relics such as plain coarse potteries, red burnished potteries, stone polished daggers, tubular jades
                and burnt
                rices.</p>
            <h5>b) Burial Urns</h5>
            <p>All burial urns were single-pottery and stood upright in pit. One of them was surrounded with three small
                slabs and
                covered with one flat slab. The other two urns were buried in pits with no slab surrounding. However,
                they have a
                slab cover. On the bottom of two urns, there is a hole which is supposed to be used for drainage.
                Several scores of
                tubular jades were found in a burial urn.</p>
            <h5>c) Stone-lined Pit Tomb</h5>
            <p>It was built with stone slabs: several flat pieces were laid on the bottom, 4 or 5pieces of stone slabs
                constituted
                each of the side walls and 1 or 2 slabs made up the head and foot walls. Cover is an oval flat stone and
                is enough
                to cover the whole pit. The tomb which oriented to north contained 1 Liaoning style bronze dagger, 1
                bronze chisel,
                17 pieces of tubular jade made of Amazone stone, 2 comma-shaped jades, 1 stone dagger, and 11 stone
                arrow-heads
                which show deep relation with the Bronze culture in Liaoning area, north-eastern China.</p>
            <h5>d) Kiln Site</h5>
            <p>It was damaged too severely to trace the original structure, but the plan is round, and is supposed to be
                an open
                fire Kiln site. Much clods of burnt earth were found at this site. It produced lots of sherds of plain
                coarse
                potteries, red burnished potteries and a small stone polished dagger. This is the first example of
                prehistoric kiln
                site found in Korea.</p>
            <h4>2. Relics</h4>
            <h5>a) Plain coarse Pottery</h5>
            <p>There are several types such as Songguk-ri type, bowl, deep bowl and plain pottery with foot. Paste
                contains some
                particles of quartz, felspar and sand, but some potteries are analyzed to be made of pure fine clay.
                Songguk-ri type
                is characterized by outward-curving mouth, swollen body and diminished flat bottom, which has not been
                found in
                Korean peninsula.</p>
            <h5>b) Red Burnished Pottery</h5>
            <p>It has also several types: Songguk-ri type, long-necked jar, bowl, deep bowl, and plain pottery with
                foot. Paste is
                usually composed with fine clay, but some of them is tempered with fine sand. Long-necked jar has a form
                of round
                flat bottom, swollen body curved with dull angle and outward-curving mouth, which is a new example from
                Bronze Age
                sites in Korea.</p>
            <h5>c) Blackish Pottery</h5>
            <p>Only two pieces were excavated. One is a piece from bottom, and the other is of body. The tempered clay
                is mixed with
                fine sand. Both side of the pottery are blackish, but not polished. The shape of pottery is unknown.</p>
            <h5>d) Stone Implements</h5>
            <p>Stone artifacts for practical use such as dagger, arrowhead, spearhead, semi-lunar knife, saddle quern,
                plane blade,
                whetstone, spindle whirl and grooved axe were excavated, while no fishing implement was found. Mostly,
                schist,
                shale, sandstone of sedimentary rocks were used. Slate, hornfels of metamorphic rocks were also used.
                Most of
                semi-lunar knife for harvesting is characterized by alternative uniface blade with only one exception.
                All
                arrowheads have tangs. A lot of whetstones used for grinding other stone tools indicated that Songguk-ri
                inhabitant
                could make all kind of stone tools for themselves. Many semi-lunar knives tell the arrival of the
                farming.</p>
            <h4>3. Others</h4>
            <p>There were two relics which were found for the first time from the dwelling site in southern part of
                Korean
                peninsula: one is a piece of burnt wooden plank (40&times;30&times;1cm thick) and the other, stone mould
                of
                fan-shaped bronze axe. A tubular jade was found under the plank. In Liaoning area, the fan-shaped bronze
                axe has
                usually been associated with the Liaoning type bronze dagger, and same type of dagger was found from the
                stone-lined
                pit tomb. The inhab-itants who lived in these dwelling sites, therefore, could be identified as the
                owners of the
                tomb.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>1) The area amounting to 8 hectares where the sites are located would be the largest one which was formed
                during
                single cultural stage.</p>
            <p>2) Among the plain coarse pottery, a unique shape was found, which has never been found from any other
                site. Hence
                Songguk-ri type plain coarse pottery.</p>
            <p>3) Songguk-ri people Used the burial system such as stone-lined pit tomb and burial urn which were found
                near the
                dwelling sites.</p>
            <p>4) Dominant finding of semi-lunar knives and burnt rice show that the inhab-itants were in the stage of
                rice-farming.
            </p>
            <p>5) The stone mould of an axe means they already knew the casting of bronze implements and used them for
                practical
                use. The shape of mould including Liaoning type bronze dagger from stone-lined pit tomb shows the deep
                influence
                from the bronze culture of Liaoning region.</p>
            <p>6) Chronologically, these sites could be dated to be bronze culture site between late 6th c. B. C. and
                early 4th c.
                B. C.</p>
